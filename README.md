# Research Code Bugs Repository

Welcome to the Research Code Bugs Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive log of bugs and issues encountered during my research projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and related fields. The goal is to document these bugs, provide detailed explanations, and offer solutions or workarounds.

## 1. Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to maintain a detailed record of bugs that I have encountered during my research coding activities. By documenting these issues, I aim to:
- **Facilitate Future Debugging**: By having a reference to previously encountered bugs and their solutions, I can streamline the debugging process in future projects.
- **Help Others**: Provide a searchable database of common problems and fixes, aiding others who might encounter similar issues.
- **Encourage Collaboration**: Promote knowledge sharing within the research community, encouraging contributions and discussions around common coding challenges.
- **Improve Code Quality**: Systematically addressing and solving bugs can lead to better coding practices and overall code quality in research projects.
## 2. Bug report template
- The template is here: [[2. Bug report]]
- Each bug report follows a standard template to ensure consistency and ease of understanding. The template includes the following sections:
	1. **Title**: A brief title describing the bug.
	2. **Description**: A detailed description of the bug, including the context in which it occurred.
	3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug.
	4. **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen.
	5. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened.
	6. **Solution/Workaround**: How the bug was resolved or a workaround if a solution hasn't been found.
	7. **References**: Links to relevant resources, such as documentation or related issues.
